                <p>Hello, I am Kazi Ashraf. I am quite fond of movies, and I pride myself in being a conscious consumer of movies. While that does sound a bit 
                obnoxious, all I really mean by it is that I prefer to watch movies in a conscious, active mode as opposed to passively consuming, also understood
                as "turning your brain off."</p>
            </div>
            
                <p id="desc">My favorite genre of movies are neo-noir, crime thriller and psychological thrillers. But I watch all genres of movies in general. In this web
                     development class I am given the opportunity to review three movies of my liking. The following three movies are my selection of showcased reviews, and 
                     by clicking on the names you can view the imdb rating, summary and further informations about the movies. Also if you wish to watch any of those movies in the future
                    and don't want spoilers, this is your spoiler warning.</p>
