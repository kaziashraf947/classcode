      <div id="title">Memories of Murder: </div>
      
      <p>I am not the usual consumer of Korean media, I saw Oldboy and did not like the story. But that is not the fault of the film itself, just the subject matter of the story was not compatible with my taste. However such is not the case with this movie. It fit perfectly with the type of movie I like. It is not a movie that is "just ok", rather something you should hold in high regard, especially considering the low budget.</p><p>
      
      The movie starts with a relaxed mood, somewhat comedic. Which almost seemed surreal considering the initial subject matter, a rape-murder of a young girl, whose dead body was found under the gutter of a rural Korean village. Throughout the movie, every character is slowly but surely unraveled, like layers of onions. It has a clear progression scheme, there are certain points in the movie where you understand the gravity of what's at stake, unlike many modern movies which tend to be too jarring or have no clear progression of the story.</p><p> The movie is on the longer side, slightly more than 2 hours. At times the pacing might feel slow, but overall it has great pacing, and whenever it feels slow, the extra time is used to develop and flesh out the characters even more.
      
      As I said before, every character in the movie has a character arc, so it is understandable that it could take some time to do that. However in cases like this time is not the main concern, as if it's interesting enough the audience will consume it anyway. But it is a mountainous task to be able to develop and flesh out every main character without repeating yourself or just spreading yourself too thin. The movie makes that look easy.</p><p> When the junior deputy loses his leg it's almost as if your own partner in crime got amputated.
      
      My major gripe with the movie would be that we never got to see the fate of the junior deputy. Well, we didn't see the fate of most of the characters, but depending on who you rooted for, the junior deputy story feels the most inconclusive. There were some really nice touches in the movie, especially when the lead detective is seen staring at the interrogation sock of the junior deputy, after the amputation. The overall lack of guns in the detectives' possession, or their unwillingness to use them even if the situation called for it was very interesting, considering they did not have an ethical problem with framing innocent mentally disabled person.
      
      All in all, definitely worth watching, the rewatch value is not as high because the twist is revealed. But if you enjoy the journey itself that's not a concern and the movie makes sure the journey is enjoyable.</p>

      <div id="title">Apollo 18: </div>

      <p>Found footage horrors are hit or miss like many other subgenres. This one is definitively a hit. Apollo 18 is known for spawning many conspiracy theories surrounding the canceled lunar mission Apollo 18. But mentioning that alone takes credit away from the incredible building of the story and the great payoff.
      
      It starts off slow but doesn't play the trope where everything is happy and dandy until everything goes to shit all at once. From the get-go there's a feeling of impending doom, tension is well played through narrative-building. And as the story progresses something new is added to the pile of things going wrong.</p><p> The claustrophobic feeling of the "safe" spacecraft, or the total isolation of vast empty moon surface leaves you feeling unsafe at every moment, even when the charatcters are just joking around.
      
      There's not much environmental horror, other than the creeping emptiness of the uncaring moon. The primary horror is the moon spiders/crab creatures. There's some foreshadowing before it's exposed to the audience what they are. I'm glad the movie doesn't take the space zombie route as that would be lame. Rather the infection turns the person psychotic and uncanny. The infection isn't even directly blamed on the creatures themselves as there's no sign that they use the humans as anything more than a warm shell.</p><p> There's no parasitic relationship established. This is more realistic in my opinion, for a parasitic relationship to form two species need to be in the same ecosystem for while or at least need a mediating species.
      
      The secondary horror is the government conspiracy aspect of the film. Without it, the movie would be another run-of-the-mill horror movie with no real substance. The great acting allows you to see the authentic feeling of desperation when your only lifeline tells you it's too "risky" to save you, or that you've done a "good job for your country". Because this is not just a desert survival situation or some tropical jungle, not even some icy death land. This is the moon, once your ride home has been canceled, no amount of trying will save you. No amount of determination and perseverance will keep you alive past the dwindling oxygen supply.</p><p>
      
      My girlfriend noticed something interesting, once the tension is at its peak, the last man on the moon said "they knew what was going on down here". The moon is not necessarily "down here", up here would be more accurate. But once moon and humans have uncovered their true horror, moon feels like like hell itself. This is why the "down here" comment.</p>
      
      All in all, definitely worth watching. Although the arg aspects of the movie is gone by now, the sites and their domains are all up for sale.

<div id="title">Repo men:</div>
<p>I have a test for movies, to check whether or not it’s a good movie. Since the basis of my taste in movies was formed through trashy pop-Hollywood movies, it’s always been difficult for me to distinguish between a movie that’s barely watchable vs one that’s truly good. Especially since there are so many movies that teeter on the verge of being good without actually being good, my test becomes more and more needed, at least for myself.

The test goes like this, I start watching a movie, about halfway through I quit watching it and do something else, usually picking it up the next day. The reason for this is two-fold. Mainly because even a good movie starts to wear me down and I end up needing to take a break around halftime (consequences of low attention span due to internet usage). And the other reason is fatigue management. Based on whether or not it was a good movie I will feel recharged by the next day to watch it, and if it was shitty I will feel aversion to it, it will feel more like a chore. And one movie that feels like a chore even before the halfway point is the 2010 SciFi thriller Repo Men.

</p><p>Repo Men is the movie adaptation of the book Repossession Mambo, so obviously a case of “the book was better” would be prevalent, but I haven’t read the book before so I went it completely fresh-minded. The plot was very promising and interesting at first, post-capitalist sci-fi about the medical industry charging an exorbitant premium for “high quality” medical services that end up costing their lives, AND a cool bounty hunter? Sign me up! The lack of humanity in their sales pitch and upselling of their “professionally done removal procedure” was reminiscent of parents taking never-ending loans for their children at a big university, or sleazy car salesman selling you a bad financing deal as a good one at 19% APR. So it had the relatability factor as well. I mean who hasn’t had a bad experience with the medical industry?</p>
<p>But even this is wrecked by the movie as it pulls one cliche after another and slowly devolves the movie into a festival of “shit you’ve seen” and “shit you don’t wanna see”.

Some plot holes detach you from the whole “relating with the protagonist”. We’re supposed to care about the fact that the protag has a wife and son, and family becomes a great big motivator later in the movie as a driver of character development in the protag. But we barely spend any quality time with the family, and the only significance the first wife holds is that she’s a naggy bitch. At least the director could make the excuse that the first family has so little screentime, but the same thing happens with the new girlfriend the protag finds from the ruins of a crackhouse. She gets to spend the rest of the movie with the protagonist and yet we know barely anything about her other than that she is really dumb, irrational, and vastly artificial.</p>

<p>The only serious acting and enjoyment in the movie come from the “buddy cop” dynamics between the protagonist and his friend. And even that is by no effort of Jude Law who was as frigid as ever. But his buddy was pretty awesome and enjoyable. Most importantly he fits the need of his role, at least until the last moment. He put energy in this psychotic murderer role, who is an adrenaline junkie essentially. Interestingly the protagonist is supposed to be similar but we barely see that side of his. In like two of the flashbacks he’s this brutish low IQ adrenaline junkie but it has no bearing on his current personality.

Aside from character development, the plot writing is equally garbage.</p><p> The last bit of creativity was spent selecting a preexisting plotline for the movie, the rest has nothing to do with the plot. You’ve seen this plot countless times, the heartless pawn of a totalitarian state/ corporation finds himself at the wrong end of the oppression stick, which causes severe personality change that can’t be justified by said oppression. It takes the same route as those generic cookie-cutter plots, there is nothing new to be discussed.

The only thing the movie does that could be unique or creative is the ending. The ending pulls a “ but what if it was all a dream” which significantly subverts the expectation of the audience at the end of the movie, who are probably wanting to leave the theatre to relieve themselves of the gallon of coke they’ve drunk. It’s always a red flag when the idea that your story never existed is more appealing to your audience than the story itself.</p>

<p>A few more gripes to address before we wrap it up, it never made sense that their nanotech bullshit 9000 neural network is supposed to only keep the person in pure bliss and happiness, but there’s plenty of “pain and suffering” before it kicks in, that’s never explained or addressed in the movie. And it doesn’t start glitching until the simulation reaches the paradise island either. And the mutual surgery scene inside the server room that’s equivalent to a sex scene did not need to be made. It was distasteful, uncomfortable, and cheap. Almost felt like fan service to devalue what little dignity was left of the movie. It’s supposed to be this deep connecting moment between our protag and the heroine, but we know nothing about her, and she’s been nothing but eye candy and liability so far in the movie, so it’s not deep, it’s sleazy and cheap.</p>


<p>And the final issue that I can think of, the whole movie the protagonist is a bad person on his journey towards moral redemption. But we keep looking at his other character flaws, less severe than killing indebted people, but still severe enough. Such as he doesn’t care about his wife, since it takes him so little effort to get over her. He claims to care about his son a lot. But in the paradise island where both his friend and his new girlfriend are there, we don’t see any mention or afterthought about his son. He uses “but all I can think of is their family” as his justification to not kill indebted people, but later in the movie, he has no problems killing security guards and other bounty hunters, who don’t have any families or loved ones? It’s so painfully obvious that his only rise in sudden morality is stemming from the fear that eventually, he will end up on the wrong end of the blade. But the movie doesn’t handle these moral flaws cleverly and maturely, they’re just dumped on the viewers and the movie pretends they don’t exist. We are supposed to treat the protag as the good guy when he does everything to prove it otherwise. The ending is more or less redeeming but it ties into the previous problem that it’s a red flag.</p>


Another movie that faced similar problems and danced with the dangerously boring cliche, without being consumed by it was Blade Runner 2049. Almost the whole movie has the formulaic chosen one, rebellious one written all over it, but instead of taking that narcissistic self-centered the protag chooses not to be the center of the universe and decides to make his own choices in a small and subtle way, which ultimately make his small role that much more meaningful and significant. More so than he could ever be if he took a lead role in the revolution against the big bad corporate overlord.

All in all, the movie was clearly an attempt for the film studio to hold the IP of Repo Men, for another 10-20 years or so, evident by the lack of effort and cookie-cutter writing and frigid acting. Almost would feel predatory to me if I didn’t pirate the movie instead of paying for it.
